            <h2>Known Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Static files could not be served by adding them to the webapp folder as usual, so I've added
                    a servlet mapping in web.xml to map all requests to /static/* to default. This made Tomcat serve
                    the contents of the /static folder as static files as needed.
                </li>
                <li>
                    For some reason, all unknown requests end up being handled by ServletLanding, which handles the
                    '/' pattern. This does not happen as a result of a redirect, the browser keeps showing the unknown
                    pattern while displaying the landing page.
                    <br>
                    To solve this I check the requested pattern in doGet of ServletLanding and if it is an unknown
                    pattern I forward the request to ServletError which serves an error page to the user.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>EDIT:</h3>
            <strong>
                Both problems where solved eventually by making ServletLanding handle the "/home" pattern instead of
                the "/" pattern, and adding a welcome-file-list to web.xml with "home" as one of the welcome files.
            </strong>

            <h2>Design decisions</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h6>Database</h6>
                    <p>
                        For the database I use an ArrayList of Question objects, such that the question ID is the
                        index of the question in the ArrayList.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A possible issue that may rise is if in the future, deletion of questions will be implemented.
                        In such a case, if a question is simply removed from the database, all subsequent questions
                        will have their indexes changed, and this will break the consistency of the question IDs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can be solved in two ways:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Changing the data structure without changing the API of DataAccessObject
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Adding a "deleted" field to the Question object, and implementing deletion by marking this
                            field as true.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        The advantage of the second option is the server can keep information for internal use even
                        if the user chooses to delete it and we don't want to display it on the site anymore.
                        A combination of both options is also possible, of course.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
